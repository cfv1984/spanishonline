<h4>About the teacher<img id="im_vero" src="img/vero.jpg" alt="mi_pic" /></h4>
<p>Hi! I am Veronica and I come from Buenos Aires, Argentina. For more than 6 years now I have been working - with passion and joy - as a Spanish teacher.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>My education as a Spanish teacher began with a Bachelor's Degree in Language Arts at the University of Buenos Aires, from which I have graduated with honors. Then, I received a scholarship for a Master's Program called &#34;Learning and Teaching Spanish in Multilingual and International Contexts&#34;. Thanks to it I have lived and studied in Spain, the U.S.A. and the Netherlands. I also took the course &#34;Initial Training for Teachers of Spanish as a Foreign Language&#34; (Cervantes Institute) and attended to several conferences and workshops related to Spanish teaching and learning.</p>
<br />
<p>In the year 2007 I started working as a teacher. Since then I have met students of different origins, ages, levels and interests. Besides having a deep knowledge about the published books for learning Spanish, I have also prepared educational materials specially destined to my students' needs. </p>
<br />
<p>My students say that I am a cheerful, patient and vocational teacher. </p>
