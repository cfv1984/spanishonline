<h2>Your Spanish course</h2>
<h4>About the approach and methodology</h4>
<br />
<p>All my lessons are based in the communicative approach. In this globalized and interconnected world, communication is a key feature for the future. Therefore, in my courses you will be active and using Spanish to express yourself from the first day.</p>
<br />
<p>If you want to know a language it is also important to learn about the community that speaks it. Those details about everyday life, music, movies and ways of communicating are the ones that make a language lesson a true experience of cultural exchange. In class we will use authentic and current materials from different Spanish-speaking countries and of different formats: songs, videos, news, blogs, photographs, etc.</p>
<br />
<p>My philosophy as a teacher is that each student is unique: he/she has his/her own interests, needs and learning style. That is why it is essential for me to get to know my students and design a specific course according to their objectives. </p>
